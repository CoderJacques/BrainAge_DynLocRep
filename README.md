# Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Neighborhoods for BrainAge Prediction on 3D Stiffness Maps

![asd](assets/teaser.png)

In the field of neuroimaging, accurate brain age prediction is pivotal for uncovering the complexities of brain aging and pinpointing early indicators of neurodegenerative conditions. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning, particularly in contrastive learning, have demonstrated greater robustness when dealing with complex datasets. However, current approaches often fall short in generalizing across non-uniformly distributed data, prevalent in medical imaging scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that  adapts dynamically during the training process, focusing on the localized neighborhoods of samples. Moreover, we expand beyond traditional structural features by incorporating brain stiffnessâ€”a mechanical property previously underexplored yet promising due to its sensitivity to age-related changes.
This work presents the first application of self-supervised learning to brain mechanical properties, using compiled stiffness maps from various clinical studies to predict brain age. Our approach, featuring dynamic localized loss, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance and paving the way for new directions in brain aging research.

## Dependencies

python=3.9

numpy=1.26.4

pandas=2.2.1

scikit-learn=1.4.1

scipy=1.12.0

torch=2.2.1

torchvision=0.17.1

wandb=0.16.3


## Running 

### Training

- `src/pretrain_main_infonce.py`: for pre-training on openBHB dataset
- `src/main_dyn_loc_rep.py`: for training models with dynamic localised repulsion loss

To simplify usage, the scripts `src/pretrain_launcher.py` and `src/launcher_dyn_loc_rep.py` come with predefined configurations available as YAML templates in `src/configs`. To initiate:

```
python3 src/pretrain_launcher.py src/configs/pretrain_infonce.yaml
```
to run the pre-training on [openBHB dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/openbhb-multi-site-brain-mri-dataset-age-prediction-and-debiasing) under configuration specfied in `src/configs/pretrain_infonce.yaml`. Similarly, to initate training using the dynamic localised repulsions loss:

```
python3 src/launcher_dyn_loc_rep.py src/configs/dyn_loc_rep.yaml
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate models, use:

```
python3 src/evaluate_model.py
```

### Model checkpoints

The checkpoints of the pre-trained model are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/388sxcfqm8j5wqi8wd48s/h?rlkey=3ecj0nq4xu164kr7tbb47p6dt&dl=0).
